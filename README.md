## Description

This repository serves as a collection of bash scripts that I find useful for various purposes. Each script is designed to perform a specific task or automate a certain process. They are most certainly not perfect, but they get the job done and I hope that they can be useful to others as well. I will continue to add more scripts to this repository as I create them and adapt existing ones to be more useful.
